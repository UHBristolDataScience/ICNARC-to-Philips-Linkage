This flag is useful because there are encounterIds which we know have an issue but which we do not alter. For example, very occasionally a patient is discharged from ICU and then readmitted but is never removed from the Philips system. In such cases we know that a single encounterId in Philips (and in ICNARC) corresponds to two physical ICU stays. With the \"error_type\" flag, the user of the data can decide how they want to deal with different types of error during data processing.    \n",
