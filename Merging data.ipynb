It also creates a new column, *encounterId_original*, that contains the original ids prior to replacement.

It gives a string containing one of 16 error types identified by Josh Inoue (UHB) and described in the file \"Philips encounterId Read Me.txt\", or contains \"NA\" if there is no known error. This flag is useful because there are encounterIds which we know have an issue but which we do not alter. For example, very occasionally a patient is discharged from ICU and then readmitted but is never removed from the Philips system. In such cases we know that a single encounterId in Philips (and in ICNARC) corresponds to two physical ICU stays. With the *error_type* flag, the user of the data can decide how they want to deal with different types of error during data processing.      "
